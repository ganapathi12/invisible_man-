The-Invisible-man:  Removing a person from images using the technique of Image Segmentation.

in a simple way i can explain you that i used image segmentation to identify background and foreground and from another picture i masked the background and i merged the both images.

i have uploaded two files one which works on loading images and another one i have implemented in real time, forthe real time program you need to record your empty background video (min recording time is 1 min)and save video in your working direcory as trail (you need powerful computation power to do this else it will be too slow).

In case you wish to learn more about image segmentation, i would like to recommend this blogpost  I really enjoyed reading it! It's really great.      https://www.learnopencv.com/image-segmentation/
